    <p>A California native, I was born and raised in Southern California. My eventual photographic interests were shaped at an early age by family trips along the California Coast and to the Canadian Rockies. Though I had always enjoyed looking at landscape photography I didn’t take an interest in photography until in college. Prior to then I had always thought of photography as “boring” studio portrait sessions and wedding photography. A few years later, I discovered the works of Galen Rowell through a copy of Outdoor Photographer magazine that my cousin had brought along on a road trip. That inspired me to pursue photography as a lifestyle. Things came full circle several years later when Outdoor Photographer asked me to write and illustrate an article for their magazine. I've since spent a significant portion of my adult life pursuing the art of photography. Though I started off shooting with print and slide film, I purchased my first digital camera in 2001 (much earlier than most current photographers) and now work exclusively in that medium. The amount of detail that can be reproduced from digital files is unrivaled. In 2021, I added a drone to my toolbox for aerial photography and am FAA certified. I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife and two young children</p>
    <h2>SMUGGLER'S NOTCH</h2>

    <p>Due to the signing of The Embargo Act of 1807 by President Thomas Jefferson, it was illegal to trade goods with Great Britain and Canada. Since Vermont was adjacent to Canada many people continued to smuggle goods and livestock over the present-day Smuggler's Notch. Fugitives used to run from the law by climbing over Smugglers' Notch and escaping to Canada. The Notch was also a hotbed of alcohol sales during the Prohibition Era with a vast quantity of liquor coming from neighboring Canada. Its safe to say that Smugglers' Notch has truly earned its' notorious name. As for myself? I smuggle fall color photos

    <h2>LONESOME CYPRESS TREE</h2>
    <img id="J" class="saturate" src="Images/Picture 2.jpg" alt="&nbsp;Lonesome Cypress Tree">
    <p>Living around the San Francisco Bay, wind is a common fact of life. Since wind is invisible we're left with photographing the result of the wind; gnarled tree limbs in this instance</p>
    <h2>PHOTOGRAPHER'S PARADISE</h2>
    <img id="J" class="grayscale" src="Images/Picture 3.jpg" alt="&nbsp;Photographer's Paradise">
    <p>Having lived in San Francisco a decade prior, I had long wanted to relocate back to the Bay Area to spend more time photographing Mount Tamalpais aka Mount Tam. In 2013 I finally relocated back to the bay and captured the photo of my dreams shortly after.</p>
